--___TODO___--

todo:
- make toBSL collapse cond expressions (so there's only one at every level)
- have toBSL use the pretty printer better so it prints more prettily
- images (svg)
  - make library implementing subset of 2htdp
     - circle, square, triangle
     - above, beside, overlay
- bsl import (BSL to Table)

bugs:
- things listed in email from Ken
    - formulas with nonboolean field and no children sometimes treated as boolean formulas
    - output cells under dummy children formulas should show pink/gray when relevent
    - input fields and want fields should be same width as the cell they're in
    - header rows should extend to end of table (have empty cells after last formula)

stuff that may be nice:
- undo/redo button

stuff that will probably happen eventually:
- actually figrure out where/how to host this
