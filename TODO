--___TODO___--

todo:
- differentiate between programs and values
- images (svg)
  - make library implementing subset of 2htdp
     - pentagon, hexagon, star
  - image comparison
  - make image painting work in lists etc.
- represent signature and purpose statement in table (also put in bsl field)

- bsl import (BSL to Table)
- have toBSL use the pretty printer better so it prints more prettily

bugs:
  - dummy children should always show gray/pink cells when relevent

bugs I don't know how to fix:
  - when using unparser that can display both text and images, error messages
    don't look right because js error messages can't display images

stuff that may be nice:
- undo/redo button

stuff that will probably happen eventually:
- actually figrure out where/how to host this
