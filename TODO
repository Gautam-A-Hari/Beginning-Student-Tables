--___TODO___--

todo:
- make toBSL show the literal typed-in expressions in check-expects
- make toBSL collapse cond expressions (so there's only one at every level)
- checkbox for showing bsl output (maybe later change it so it indicates whether it
      should expect input from the field or print output to the field or something)
- change cons mode/list mode buttons to drop-down menu
- images (svg/canvas?)
- bsl import (BSL to Table)

bugs:

stuff that may be nice:
- undo/redo button

stuff that will probably happen eventually:
- actually figrure out where/how to host this
