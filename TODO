--___TODO___--

todo:
- differentiate between programs and values
- images (svg)
  - make library implementing subset of 2htdp
     - pentagon, hexagon, star
  - image comparison
     - figure out wierd state problem (description in comments of App.js)

- bsl import (BSL to Table)
- have toBSL use the pretty printer better so it prints more prettily

bugs:
  - dummy children should always show gray/pink cells when relevent
  - sometimes table names, parameter names are accepted as valid when
    they shouldn't be

bugs I don't know how to fix:
  - when using unparser that can display both text and images, error messages
    don't look right because js error messages can't display images
     - current workaround:
       have a seperate function called toString that only returns a string (not
       an array of strings and svg) which is used to make error messages
     - possible better fix:
       make a new "Error" data type that holds a message which is an array
       of strings and svg and use this instead of js Errors

stuff that may be nice:
- undo/redo button

stuff that will probably happen eventually:
- actually figrure out where/how to host this
