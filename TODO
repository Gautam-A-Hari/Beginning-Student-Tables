--___TODO___--

todo:
- make toBSL collapse cond expressions (so there's only one at every level)
- make pretty printer print more prettily
    - maybe make a parser that takes an s-expr and returns a doc?
- images (svg/canvas?)
- bsl import (BSL to Table)

bugs:

stuff that may be nice:
- undo/redo button

stuff that will probably happen eventually:
- actually figrure out where/how to host this
