--___TODO___--

now:
 -----------------------------------------------------------
| make stuff not ugly                                       |
| make boolean columns feel more like cond and less like if |
 -----------------------------------------------------------

implement recursion
    - ability to name tables
    - table name refers to function that maps a set of in examples to the corresponding want text
      - this mapping must exist, else error
 - issues
   - not sure how to get the function described above into the environment from which the js function eval runs
   - could parse the fexpr functions and replace references to 'tableName(inputs)' with the corresponding values,
       but this would only work with literals, not with variables
     to make it work with variables I would pretty much have to write a minimal js interpreter, which I don't really
     want to do
   - I'd rather get back to this issue later when writing the racket interpreter, because then I'll have more control over
     the environment
   - alternatively I can try to better understand how eval works
      

later: 
Make Racket Interpreter
