# Table Method Thing
It's like the Recursive Argument Method except not at all

## How to use
So there's a directory called "prototypes" which contains the
prototypes of the javascript implementation of the table
method. Currently there's only one prototype, in the directory called
"one". To view this prototype and what it does, open index.html (which
itsel is within "one") in some browser that supports modern
implementations of javascript and jsx.
