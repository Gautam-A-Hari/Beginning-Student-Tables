<!--# Beginning Student Tables
(formerly known as the Table Method Thing)

It's like the Recursive Argument Method except not at all

## How to use
### easy way
click me: http://cedar.sice.indiana.edu:35888/Beginning-Student-Tables/

note: the version of the Table Method Thing at this link may be several commits behind
### slightly less easy way that lets you play around with the code more
1. clone the repo

2. install npm (the NodePackageManager)

   on Debian it's probably
   ```
   sudo apt install npm
   ```
   on Fedora it's probably
   ```
   sudo dnf install npm
   ```
   so however you install packages on your OS/distribution, just do that

3. go to the project directory (two)
   ```
   cd path/to/repo/prototypes/two
   ```

4. using npm, install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. run ```npm start``` to start a development server

6. have fun!

If this doesn't make sense, the README in ```prototypes/two``` contains more info.

## How to Publish (i.e. pushing to gh-pages)
1. go to project directory (two)
   ```
   cd path/to/repo/prototypes/two
   ```

2. using npm, run ```build```
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

3. run server in server directory using racket
   ```
   cd ../../server
   mkdir -p logs
   racket server.rkt
   ```

## For Students
<!-- have two sections: one for c211, one for other backgrounds -->
**Already familiar with the Beginning Student Language?** Great! That means you're probably also already familiar with check-expects. This tool allows you to write and test different formulas with your check-expects easily! ...

**Never seen this language before?** No worries! Beginning Student Language check-expects are just like unit tests. The BSL Table tool allows you to design functions and run unit tests on them. To get started with BSL's paranthesized syntax, refer to the [Parenthesized Syntax](#parenthesized-syntax) section below! ... 

### Using the Table Tool
Transition line... (something about getting to know the table, and being familiart with the design recipe)

This section tells the user about the layout of the table tool: what the name field is, signature field, purpose, inputs, params, want, formula and etc...

* **Definitions Area** this is where you can define constants, functions, or structures
* **Check-Expect Area** write your check-expects here, then add them to your tables using the 'import button'

**Table Header**
* **'Table Name' cell** where you will write the name of the function you're writing
* **'Signature' cell** where you will write the signature (same as contract) of the function: the input types and output type
* **'Purpose' cell** as the name implies, this is where you will write the purpose of the function

**Table Body**
* **Paramter cell** this is where you name the inputs to your function, add more by typing into the green 'dummy cell' next to it
* **Formula cell** here you can write arithmetic which the table will evaluate using your inputs, to start making a new formula, start writing in the green 'dummy cell'.
* **Input cell** the inputs to your function, add more by typing into the green 'dummy cell' next to it
* **Want cell** this is where you will type the expected value for the given input in that row
* **Output cell** this is where the output of your formulas will appear, if output is not evaluated it will be gray, if there is an error it will appear pink

* **Language dropdown** you can select to either use BSL or BSL with list abbreviations
* **Show Combined Program** click the checkbox to generate the BSL code for your tables

It's important to remember the colors used by the table. Yellow indicates new cells, green indicates dummy cells which when typed into will make yellow cells, pink cells means there is an error, and gray cells are unused. 

### Examples of Uses
Here are some example cases on how you can use the Beginning Student Tables tool to write functions and solve problems. First let's look at a simple case, where we try to convert a temptertature in celsius to fahrenheit. 
1. Simple Use
- The problem: write a function to convert celsius to fahrenheit 
- Ways to approach this problem: 
   1. Write inputs and wants. Type in the formula you think will work. Adjust the formula to pass all the written examples!
   2. Write check-expects in the 'check-expect area'. Write a formula. Adjust the formula to pass all the written examples!
- Let's test it out!
   - First, let's fill in the function name, signature, and write some examples:
   - < image showing this here >
   - Let's start with this formula: `(+ c 32)`
   - This gets one of our cases write but not the other...
   - In a new formula cell, let's try to build on it : `(+ 32 (* 1.8 c))`
   - Great! This formula passes all of our tests!
- We can generate this BSL code using the 'Show Combined Program' check-box below the last table.
< image here maybe >
- This generated code includes our intermediate tries for formulas, so let's make sure to get rid of that before using it elsewhere.

That was really easy, how about we look at a slightly more complicated example that requires recursion.

2. Recursive Use
- The problem: write a function that sums a list of numbers
- Ways to approach this problem:
   1. Write a single input and want, and write your formula. Use the 'add example' button to fill in the rest of the inputs. Write desired wants for these inputs
   2. Write check-expects in the 'check-expects area'. 
- Let's test it out!
   - To begin, let's fill in the function name, signature and write some examples
   - < image showing this here >
   - Since we will be adding all the numbers in the list together, lets try to add the first number of the list with the sum of the rest of the list:
   `
   (+ (first lon) (sum (rest lon)))
   `
   - It looks like we're missing an example for the recursion. We can add it by using the 'add example' button in the output cell.
   - < image showing this here >
   - We get an error saying 'expected a cons, but given empty list'. So let's add a conditional to check wether the given input is a non-empty list or an empty list:
   - In the second formula cell: `(cons? lon)` , and in the formula cell next to that: `(empty? lon)`
   - As you can see, we get new formula cells below these:
   - < image showing this here >
   - We can use the formula from the previous steps for the `(cons? lon)` case
   - Since the sum of an empty list is zero, we can just write 0 under the `(empty? lon)` case
   - It works!
- Like before, we can generate the BSL code for this table using the 'Show Combined Proram' check-box below the table. Again, make sure to delete the intermidate steps before using it elsewhere. 

#### Recap of Use
Some of the things we learned:
- You can import check-expects or manually write inputs/wants
- Adjust formulas in new formula cells
- Generate BSL code using the 'show combined program' checkbox

### Parenthesized Syntax 
As described by "How to Design Programs", the Beginning Student Language is:
> Quote describing the language here

#### Quick Rundown
Here are a few quick things to know about BSL to get you started:
- BSL uses parenthsized prefix notation syntax: 
   - Operators come before the operands: 
   ```
   (operator operand-one operand-two)
   ```
   - So, adding five and two: 
   ```
   (+ 5 2)
   ```
- Strings are specified with double quotes:
- Variables are assigned using the `define` function:
   - Assigning the value 5 to x :
   ```
   (define x 5)
   ```
- Lists can be defined in two ways:
   - using `cons` to define a list of elements, one and two (more on this below) :
   ```
   (cons 1 (cons 2 empty))
   ```
   - using the abbreviated `list` syntax to define a list of elemnts, one and two:
   ```
   (list 1 2)
   ```
   - note that spaces are used instead of commas
- Unit tests can be written using the `check-expect` function (more on this below):
   - calls the specified function and compares it with specified output:
   ```
   (check-expect (+ 5 2) 7)
   ```
   - the above `check-expect` will be `#true` since 5 plus 2 is 7
   - specifically, the inputs to `+` are 5 and 2, and the 'want' for it is 7

#### Closer Look
Let's take a closer look at the important features of BSL.

- **Functions** more on using/defining functions

- **Variables** more on variables

- **Lists** more on lsits here

- **Unit Tests/Check-expects** more on unit tests here

- **Structures** more on structures here

- **Primitives** link to the current list of supported primitives

## For Developers
Two line description on development.

In this section we will cover the project structure, and then how to add some features. 

### Project Structure
This application is written in TypeScript using React.

The project consisits of three importnat parts. The main App component, the table components, and the interpereter. The App component is at the top of the program hierarchy and either directly or inderectly interacts with almost all other sections of the program.


#### App Component
< breakdown of what App.tsx does and how >

#### Table Components
< breakdown of the funcionality of several of the components that make up the table >

#### Interpreter
< breakdown of the how the interpreter is written >

#### Types
* input-definitions.ts - this file contains the data definitions for the Table. There are two sections of this file: the actual Types and the type-guards. 

You can find more extensive documentation inside the files. 

### Examples

< I think most of the explanation should be covered in the above section >
1. Adding a Function
   - We'll add a function that returns the first character of a given string, let's call it `first-char`
   - Functions are part of the interpreter, so open `/path/to/prototypes/two/src/interpreter.js' in your IDE
   - To begin, let's define a new function, which will handle the logic for `first-char` :
      ```
      function firstChar(args) {
         // logic here...
      }
      ```
   - You can note two important detials here, `firstChar` takes 'args' as a paramter, and that it returns an object with a value and a type. We'll cover the latter a bit later.
   - when this function will be called the operands are passed as paramters, that is, `args` will be the operands to our new function `first-char`. So in our case, `args` should be a string.
   - First, let's check that we only get one operand, this means that the length of `args` should be 1. Otherwise, we should throw an Error.
   - It's also a good iea to check that operand is a string. We can do this by using a type-check. This is what the logic inside `firstChar` should currently look like:  
      ```
      // check argument length
      if (args.length != 1) {
         throw new Error('arity mismatch');
      }
      // check function operand types
      typeCheck(args[0], [RSTRING_T]);
      ```
   - `RSTRING_T` is the corresponding type to a string in our interpreter < this should be covered in the above sections ... >
   - Now its time to actually perform what we want `first-char` to do!
   - To get the first character of a string, we can simply call substring on the given string, making sure to check that it has one character at least:
      ```
      let str = args[0];
      let value; 
      if (str.length > 0) {
         value = str.substring(0, 1);
      } else {
         value = "";
      }

      // same as: value = str.length > 0 ? str.substring(0, 1) : "";
      ```
   - Keep in mind that this is function will be evaluted by our interpreter, so let's return it in accordingly: 
      ```
      return {value: value , type: RSTRING_T};
      ```
   - This is what the body of `firstChar` should look like:
      ```
      // check argument length
      if (args.length != 1) {
         throw new Error('arity mismatch');
      }
      // check function operand types
      typeCheck(args[0], [RSTRING_T]);
      // calculate return value
      let str = args[0];
      let value; 
      if (str.length > 0) {
         value = str.substring(0, 1);
      } else {
         value = "";
      }

      return {value: value , type: RSTRING_T};
      ```
   - The last thing we need to do is add it to protoEnv :
      ```
      protoEnv = [
         ...
         { name: 'first-char', binding: { type: RFUNC_T, value: firstChar } }
      ];
      ```
   - < a little breakdown of this >
   - Congrats! You have successfully added a new function to the BSL Table Tool!
