# Table Method Thing
It's like the Recursive Argument Method except not at all

## How to use
### easy way

### slightly less easy way that lets you play around with the code more
1. clone the repo

2. install npm (the NodePackageManager)

   on Debian it's probably
   ```
   sudo apt install npm
   ```
   on Fedora it's probably
   ```
   sudo dnf install npm
   ```
   so however you install packages on your OS/distribution, just do that

3. go to the project directory (two)
   ```
   cd path/to/repo/prototypes/two
   ```

4. using npm, install react-scripts
   ```
   npm install react-scripts
   ```

5. run ```npm start``` to start a development server

6. have fun!

If this doesn't make sense, the README in ```prototypes/two``` contains more info.
