New Data Definitions:
        A Table is
                {examples:      [Example],
                 fexprs:        [Fexpr],
                 params:        [String],
                 name:          String}

        An Example is
                {inProgs:           [Program],
                 wantProg:          Program}

        A Fexpr is
                {prog:              Program,
                 outExprs:          [outExpr], (not strictly necessary)
                 thenChildren:      [Fexpr]}

        An outExpr is one of
                - Program
                - Error

        A Program is one of
                -  Variable
                -  Application
                -  RFunction
                -  RNum
                -  RBool
                -  RString
                -  RList
                -  RSym

        A Variable is a
                {value: String,
                 type:  0}

        An Application is a
                {value: {funct: RFunction,
                         args:  [Program]},
                 type:  1}

        A RFunction is a
                {value: Function
                 type:  2}

        An RNum is a
                {value: Number,
                 type:  3}

        An RBool is a
                {value: Boolean,
                 type:  4}

        An RString is a
                {value: String,
                 type:  5}

        An RList is a
                {value: List,
                 type:  6}

        A List is one of
                - Null
                - {a: Program,
                   d: RList}

        An RSym is a
                {value: string,
                 type: 7}
