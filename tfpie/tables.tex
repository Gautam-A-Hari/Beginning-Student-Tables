I want to show you a new tool that we developed at Indiana
University to help beginning students design programs systematically.
This tool is called Beginning Student Tables, and here's how it works.

Suppose we want a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.  We
write down the name of the function, the signature of the function,
and the purpose of the function.  But what is the formula?  Before we
develop the general formula, we should first come up with some specific
examples of the function at work---in other words, we should put down
some unit tests, made of inputs and outputs.  For example, we know that
32 degrees Fahrenheit is 0 degrees Celsius, and 212 degrees Fahrenheit
is 100 degrees Celsius.

Looking at these examples, our first attempt at a general formula might
be to take the input f and subtract 32\@.  This works for the first
example but not the second.  But we are getting close.  We can take
this intermediate result and divide it by 1.8\@.  Now we've got it.  The
checkmarks show which results match the expected outputs we want, on the
right.  Our goal is to make a column that has checkmarks all the way
down.  We can add more examples to take our formula and test it further.

PRINCIPLE: Trying out more guesses is always OK without deleting prior
guesses.  (We used this principle to decide how to treat conditionals.)

By the way, this tool is on the Web, so you could try it out yourself.

PRINCIPLE: Generated code can be turned into working code by deleting
bad or intermediate guesses.

What if we have a more complicated problem, where we need to use
different formulas under different conditions?  Suppose we want a
function that returns the larger of two numbers, x and y.  Again we
write down the name of the function, the signature of the function, and
the purpose of the function.  We also write some examples.  However, it
is clear that neither the formula x nor the formula y will give us what we want all the
time.  Instead, we need to check if x is less than y.  When the programmer
enters a formula whose results are all true or false, Beginning Student
Tables treats it as a condition, and allows the programmer to enter
formulas under the condition.  These formulas are only evaluated on
those rows where the conditions above them are true.  So the
programmer can try out many conditions and look for formulas that are
reliable in each condition and cover all possible test cases.  Just as
multiple formulas are allowed, multiple conditions are allowed, and they
may overlap.

By the way, when we get a table we like, we can export it as code.

For bigger programming tasks, a formula can invoke a table.  Suppose
we want to find the larger of three numbers.  We can write a formula
that takes three numbers and finds the largest number,
using the larger that we already have.  But there's a difference between
invoking a function like less-than and invoking a table like larger.  Invoking larger
is merely looking up the inputs 1 and 2 in the table that we already have, so we have to
add those inputs and specify the expected output.  And again for the
outer call to larger.  This behavior prompts the programmer to write enough
tests for a helper function like larger,
and also tells the programmer to trust the helper function larger even
before its definition is finished.

These ingredients together guide the programmer to design recursive
functions.  Suppose we want to compute the factorial of a natural
number.  Well, here are some examples.  Now, because a natural number is
either $0$ or $1$ plus another natural number, we know we probably want
the conditions $n=0$ and $n>0$.  Moreover, if $n>0$ then we probably want $n-1$
and its factorial.  Looking at what we have (the factorial of $n-1$)
and what we want (on the right), we discover
that we can multiply what we have by~$n$ to get what we want.  Note that
again, invoking fact is merely looking up the input in the table, so
if we leave out the expected output for~$4$, the test for~$5$ complains,
and if we leave out the test for~$4$ altogether, the test for~$5$
also complains.  We call this behavior pseudo-recursion.  This
generalizes to mutual recursion, where tables like even and odd invoke
each other.

Even though I've only shown numbers and booleans, we can also program
with strings (like to concatenate them), images (like to animate them),
and lists (like to sort them).  Again, our tool is called Beginning
Student Tables, and you can try it out yourself on the Web.

This work was inspired by the ``Table Method'' for thinking about writing
functions, originally invented by Felix S. Klock II when we were in grad
school, and by ideas about writing functions as tables from Shriram
Krishnamurthi.

\section{Introduction}

The optional arguments of {\tt $\backslash$documentclass$\{$eptcs$\}$} are
\begin{itemize}
\item at most one of
{\tt adraft},
{\tt submission} or
{\tt preliminary},
\item at most one of {\tt publicdomain} or {\tt copyright},
\item and optionally {\tt creativecommons},
  \begin{itemize}
  \item possibly augmented with
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt noderivs}
    \item or {\tt sharealike},
    \end{itemize}
  \item and possibly augmented with {\tt noncommercial}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
We use {\tt adraft} rather than {\tt draft} so as not to confuse hyperref.
The style-file option {\tt submission} is for papers that are
submitted to {\tt $\backslash$event}, where the value of the latter is
to be filled in in line 2 of the tex-file. Use {\tt preliminary} only
for papers that are accepted but not yet published. The final version
of your paper that is to be uploaded at the EPTCS website should have
none of these style-file options.

By means of the style-file option
\href{http://creativecommons.org/licenses/}{creativecommons}
authors equip their paper with a Creative Commons license that allows
everyone to copy, distribute, display, and perform their copyrighted
work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give credit
the way you request. By invoking the additional style-file option {\tt
noderivs} you let others copy, distribute, display, and perform only
verbatim copies of your work, but not derivative works based upon
it. Alternatively, the {\tt sharealike} option allows others to
distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the
license that governs your work. Finally, you can invoke the option
{\tt noncommercial} that let others copy, distribute, display, and
perform your work and derivative works based upon it for
noncommercial purposes only.

Authors' (multiple) affiliations and emails use the commands
{\tt $\backslash$institute} and {\tt $\backslash$email}.
Both are optional.
Authors should moreover supply
{\tt $\backslash$titlerunning} and {\tt $\backslash$authorrunning},
and in case the copyrightholders are not the authors also
{\tt $\backslash$copyrightholders}.
As illustrated above, heuristic solutions may be called for to share
affiliations. Authors may apply their own creativity here \cite{multipleauthors}.

\section{Ancillary files}

Authors may upload ancillary files to be linked alongside their paper.
These can for instance contain raw data for tables and plots in the
article, or program code.  Ancillary files are included with an EPTCS
submission by placing them in a directory \texttt{anc} next to the
main latex file. See also \url{https://arxiv.org/help/ancillary_files}.
Please add a file README in the directory \texttt{anc}, explaining the
nature of the ancillary files, as in
\url{http://eptcs.org/paper.cgi?226.21}.

\section{Prefaces}

Volume editors may create prefaces using this very template,
with {\tt $\backslash$title$\{$Preface$\}$} and {\tt $\backslash$author$\{\}$}.

\section{Bibliography}

We request that you use
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
{\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}, or one of its variants
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalpha.bst}{eptcsalpha},
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsini.bst}{eptcsini} or
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalphaini.bst}{eptcsalphaini}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}. Compared to the original {\LaTeX}
{\tt $\backslash$biblio\-graphystyle$\{$plain$\}$},
it ignores the field {\tt month}, and uses the extra
bibtex fields {\tt eid}, {\tt doi}, {\tt ee} and {\tt url}.
The first is for electronic identifiers (typically the number $n$
indicating the $n^{\rm th}$ paper in an issue) of papers in electronic
journals that do not use page numbers. The other three are to refer,
with life links, to electronic incarnations of the paper.

\paragraph{DOIs}

Almost all publishers use digital object identifiers (DOIs) as a
persistent way to locate electronic publications. Prefixing the DOI of
any paper with {\tt http://dx.doi.org/} yields a URI that resolves to the
current location (URL) of the response page\footnote{Nowadays, papers
  that are published electronically tend
  to have a \emph{response page} that lists the title, authors and
  abstract of the paper, and links to the actual manifestations of
  the paper (e.g.\ as {\tt dvi}- or {\tt pdf}-file). Sometimes
  publishers charge money to access the paper itself, but the response
  page is always freely available.}
of that paper. When the location of the response page changes (for
instance through a merge of publishers), the DOI of the paper remains
the same and (through an update by the publisher) the corresponding
URI will then resolve to the new location. For that reason a reference
ought to contain the DOI of a paper, with a life link to the corresponding
URI, rather than a direct reference or link to the current URL of
publisher's response page. This is the r\^ole of the bibtex field {\tt doi}.
{\bf EPTCS requires the inclusion of a DOI in each cited paper, when available.}

DOIs of papers can often be found through
\url{http://www.crossref.org/guestquery};\footnote{For papers that will appear
  in EPTCS and use \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
  {\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$} there is no need to
  find DOIs on this website, as EPTCS will look them up for you
  automatically upon submission of a first version of your paper;
  these DOIs can then be incorporated in the final version, together
  with the remaining DOIs that need to found at DBLP or publisher's webpages.}
the second method {\it Search on article title}, only using the {\bf
surname} of the first-listed author, works best.  
Other places to find DOIs are DBLP and the response pages for cited
papers (maintained by their publishers).

\paragraph{The bibtex fields {\tt ee} and {\tt url}}

Often an official publication is only available against payment, but
as a courtesy to readers that do not wish to pay, the authors also
make the paper available free of charge at a repository such as
\url{arXiv.org}. In such a case it is recommended to also refer and
link to the URL of the response page of the paper in such a
repository.  This can be done using the bibtex fields {\tt ee} or {\tt
url}, which are treated as synonyms.  These fields should \textbf{not} be used
to duplicate information that is already provided through the DOI of
the paper.
You can find archival-quality URL's for most recently published papers
in DBLP---they are in the bibtex-field {\tt ee}---but please suppress
repetition of DOI information. In fact, it is often
useful to check your references against DBLP records anyway, or just find
them there in the first place.

\paragraph{Typesetting DOIs and URLs}

When using {\LaTeX} rather than {\tt pdflatex} to typeset your paper, by
default no linebreaking within long URLs is allowed. This leads often
to very ugly output, that moreover is different from the output
generated when using {\tt pdflatex}. This problem is repaired when
invoking \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/breakurl.sty}
{\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$}: it allows linebreaking
within links and yield the same output as obtained by default with
{\tt pdflatex}. 
When invoking {\tt pdflatex}, the package {\tt breakurl} is ignored.

Please avoid using {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$doi$\}$}, or
{\tt $\backslash$newcommand$\{\backslash$doi$\}$}.
If you really need to redefine the command {\tt doi}
use {\tt $\backslash$providecommand$\{\backslash$doi$\}$}.

The package {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$underscore$\}$} is
recommended to deal with underscores in DOIs. This is not needed when
using {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$} and not {\tt pdflatex}.

\paragraph{References to papers in the same EPTCS volume}

To refer to another paper in the same volume as your own contribution,
use a bibtex entry with
\begin{center}
  {\tt series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume$\{5\}\}$},
\end{center}
where 5 is the submission number of the paper you want to cite.
You may need to contact the author, volume editors or EPTCS staff to
find that submission number; it becomes known (and unchangeable)
as soon as the cited paper is first uploaded at EPTCS\@.
Furthermore, omit the fields {\tt publisher} and {\tt volume}.
Then in your main paper you put something like:

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$providecommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]$\{$this
  volume of EPTCS, Open Publishing Association$\}$}

\noindent
This acts as a placeholder macro-expansion until EPTCS software adds
something like

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$newcommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]%
  $\{\{\backslash$eptcs$\}$ 157$\backslash$opa, pp 45--56, doi:\dots$\}$},

\noindent
where the relevant numbers are pulled out of the database at publication time.
Here the newcommand wins from the providecommand, and {\tt \small $\backslash$eptcs}
resp.\ {\tt \small $\backslash$opa} expand to

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$sl Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science} \hfill and\\
{\small \tt , Open Publishing Association} \hfill .

\noindent
Hence putting {\small \tt $\backslash$def$\backslash$opa$\{\}$} in
your paper suppresses the addition of a publisher upon expansion of the citation by EPTCS\@.
An optional argument like
\begin{center}
  {\tt series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume$\{5\}[$EPTCS$]\}$},
\end{center}
overwrites the value of {\tt \small $\backslash$eptcs}.

\nocite{*}
