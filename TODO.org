--___TODO___--

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* todo:
 differentiate between programs and values
** images (svg)
*** make library implementing subset of 2htdp
pentagon, hexagon, star


** bsl import (BSL to Table)
** maintain log of state
whenever state changes, add it to log (which is a list of states)
Also, a state is a list of tables (also called a Table Method Program)

*** figure out how to do something with snapshots
upload them or whatever

fetch https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

set_timeout https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout

figure out why CORS error is happening


* bugs:
** bugs I know how to fix but haven't yet
*** image comparison (actually I dunno if I know how to fix this)
figure out wierd state problem (description in comments of [[file:prototypes/two/src/App.js::// sometimes this doesn't work...][App.js]])

checking equality on place-image doesn't always produce correct results, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC
(place-image (circle 5 'solid 'red) 200 30 (empty-scene 100 100))
#+END_SRC
and
#+BEGIN_SRC
(place-image (circle 5 'solid 'red) 200 300 (empty-scene 100 100))
#+END_SRC
produce the same image (an empty-scene 100 px by 100 px), but they
are evaluated as being different sometimes, but not always...
** bugs I don't know how to fix:
*** when using unparser that can display both text and images, error messages don't look right because js error messages can't display images
**** current workaround:
have a seperate function called toString that only returns a string (not
an array of strings and svg) which is used to make error messages
**** possible better fix:
make a new "Error" data type that holds a message which is an array
of strings and svg and use this instead of js Errors


* stuff that may be nice:
undo/redo button

* stuff that will probably happen eventually:
actually figrure out where/how to host this
