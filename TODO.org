--___TODO___--

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* todo:
 differentiate between expressions and values
** images (svg)
pentagon, hexagon, star
** bsl import (BSL to Table)
** DefinitionsArea
implement
#+BEGIN_SRC
(define (name param_1 ... param_n)
  body)
#+END_SRC
i.e. function definition
* bugs:
** bugs I know how to fix but haven't yet
*** image comparison (actually I dunno if I know how to fix this)
figure out wierd state problem (description in comments of [[file:prototypes/two/src/App.js::// sometimes this doesn't work...][App.js]])

checking equality on place-image doesn't always produce correct results, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC
(place-image (circle 5 'solid 'red) 200 30 (empty-scene 100 100))
#+END_SRC
and
#+BEGIN_SRC
(place-image (circle 5 'solid 'red) 200 300 (empty-scene 100 100))
#+END_SRC
produce the same image (an empty-scene 100 px by 100 px), but they
are evaluated as being different sometimes, but not always...
** bugs I don't know how to fix:
* stuff that may be nice:
undo/redo button
* stuff that will probably happen eventually:
actually figrure out where/how to host this
